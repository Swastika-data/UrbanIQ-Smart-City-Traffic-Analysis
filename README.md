# UrbanIQ-Smart-City-Traffic-Analysis
Real-time smart city traffic analytics platform using Kafka, Spark, Snowflake &amp; Power BI
# UrbanIQ – Smart City Traffic Analysis

UrbanIQ is an end-to-end real-time analytics solution designed to analyze traffic flow and environmental conditions to support data-driven urban planning.

The platform integrates streaming ingestion, distributed processing, cloud warehousing, and BI visualization to demonstrate scalable analytics engineering principles.ates a real-world 
streaming analytics architecture used by modern smart cities.


# UrbanIQ – Smart City Traffic Analysis

##  Problem Statement

Urban traffic systems generate large volumes of streaming data. However, without structured ingestion, transformation, and modeling, this data cannot be reliably used for operational insights.

UrbanIQ demonstrates how to design a scalable analytics pipeline that transforms raw traffic and weather data into analytics-ready datasets for BI consumption.

##  System Architecture
Pipeline Layers:

Ingestion – Kafka (streaming data input)
Processing – Spark (real-time transformations)
Storage – Snowflake (cloud data warehouse)
Visualization – Power BI (business dashboards)

## Data Modeling Approach

Designed analytics-ready schemas in Snowflake
Structured transformations for metric consistency
Implemented clean separation between raw and curated layers
Optimized for downstream BI performance

## Key Features
Real-time traffic speed monitoring
Route delay analytics
City-level environmental comparison
Analytics-ready data modeling for BI


## Tech Stack
Kafka | Spark | Snowflake | Power BI | Azure | SQL

## Engineering Highlights

Designed ELT-based pipeline
Improved metric reliability through validation logic
Ensured separation of ingestion, transformation, and BI layers

##  Why This Project Matters

UrbanIQ demonstrates how real-time data pipelines can support smart city initiatives by:
- Enabling proactive traffic congestion monitoring
- Supporting data-driven decisions for traffic optimization
- Bridging technical data engineering with business and policy insights

##  Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-time incident or accident data
- Predictive congestion modeling using historical trends
- Deployment on cloud platforms for scalability
