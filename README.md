Real-time smart city traffic analytics platform using Kafka, Spark, Snowflake &amp; Power BI
# UrbanIQ – Smart City Traffic Analysis

UrbanIQ is a real-time smart city analytics platform designed to analyze traffic and weather data 
to support congestion monitoring, delay analysis, and data-driven urban planning decisions.

This project was built as part of my postgraduate capstone and simulates a real-world 
streaming analytics architecture used by modern smart cities.


# UrbanIQ – Smart City Traffic Analysis

##  Project Overview
UrbanIQ is a real-time smart city analytics platform designed to analyze traffic and weather data
to support city-level traffic optimization and decision-making.

##  Architecture
- Kafka for real-time data ingestion
- Spark Structured Streaming for processing
- Snowflake as cloud data warehouse
- Power BI for visualization

##  End-to-End Data Pipeline

1. Traffic & weather data ingestion via APIs
2. Real-time streaming using Kafka
3. Processing with Spark
4. Storage in Snowflake
5. Visualization using Power BI dashboards

## Key Insights
- Identification of congestion-prone routes using historical and streaming data
- Peak-hour delay analysis to highlight high-impact traffic windows
- Comparison of current speed vs free-flow speed to assess traffic efficiency


## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
Kafka | Spark | Snowflake | SQL | Python | Power BI

##  Why This Project Matters

UrbanIQ demonstrates how real-time data pipelines can support smart city initiatives by:
- Enabling proactive traffic congestion monitoring
- Supporting data-driven decisions for traffic optimization
- Bridging technical data engineering with business and policy insights

##  Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-time incident or accident data
- Predictive congestion modeling using historical trends
- Deployment on cloud platforms for scalability
